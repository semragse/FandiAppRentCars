# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: PostgreSQL Database Required

This application requires a PostgreSQL database to run on Railway.

## Quick Setup:

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"Add PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway will automatically connect it via `DATABASE_URL`

That's it! Your app will restart and connect to PostgreSQL.
